# OneDrive-Cloud-Player 
 
 A dedicated player to stream video content directly from OneDrive.

 The libvlc code can be found in the file `VideoPlayerPageViewModel.cs` under the folder `ViewModels`
 
 The LibVLC.UWP version is 3.1.1.1 so it should work. To encounter the bug you can upgrade the nuget to version 3.3.0
